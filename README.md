## Description
 This app features my portfolio built using VITE and REACT. It enables the user to view four different portions of the portfolio using the following nav links: 
* About me
* Portfolio
* Contact
* Resume.

It is deployed using Netlify.

## Installation

### Installation: Scaffold VITE Application
```md
1. In the command line, navigate to the desired parent folder and run `npm create vite@latest`.
    * ðŸ”‘ *Note*: This command will automatically create a sub-folder which will house your React application; you do not need to perform a `mkdir` command to create one manually.
2. Enter the desired name of your new project folder.
3. From the first list of options, select your framework; for our activities in class, we'll be using `React`.
4. From the second list of options, select your variant; for our activities in class, we'll be using `JavaScript`.
5. `cd` into your newly created project folder and run `npm install`.
    * In later activities we'll add additional NPM packages to our `vite` apps such as 'bootstrap', 'dotenv', and 'axios'.
6. Run `npm dev`/`npm run dev` and navigate to the prompted URL to see your app.
7. Navigate to your `package.json` and modify the `scripts` object so that it looks like this example:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
```
8. Navigate to the `vite.config.js` file and edit the export object so that it looks like this example:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true
  }
})
```
### Installation:  post VITE scaffolding

## Tests                 
```md

2. TEST002: HELLO WORLD: Verify that "HELLO WORLD" is displayed on the page. 
3. TEST003: HEADER COMPONENT (Header.jsx): Verify that the Header component renders HELLO WORLD. 
4. TEST004: HEADER COMPONENT NAV Links: Verify that navigation links (About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume) are rendered.
5. TEST005: HEADER COMPONENT STYLING. Verify that header component occupies the top 25% of the page and the h1 and links are displayed in white text against an attractive background. The links should be on same line as the H1 tag and the links should be displayed horizontally on the same line with space between them.
6. TEST006: MAIN & FOOTER COMPONENT CREATION. Verify that page DOM has a header, main and footer components. The header remains unchanged and is at the top of the page. The main is directly underneath the header and the footer is directly underneath the main.
7. TEST007: HOME PAGE WITH ABOUTME RENDERED:  home page renders without errors.
8. TEST008: PORTFOLIO Page-Specific Component: Verify that PORTFOLIO component renders without errors.
	8.1 Test with dummy content.  Run the application and navigate to page to ensure the dummy content is displayed. 
	8.2 Test with actual content.  Run the application and navigate to page to ensure the actual content is displayed.
9. TEST009: CONTACT Page-Specific Component: Verify that page component renders without errors. **Note**: Because this application doesnâ€™t include a back end or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't need to save this information right now. You'll add back-end functionality in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider including your email address and phone number on the Contact page.
10. TEST010: RESUME Page-Specific Component: Verify that page component renders without errors.
11. TEST011: Deploy to Netlify and test deployed app.
